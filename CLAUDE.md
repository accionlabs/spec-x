# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains the conceptual framework and specifications for **Specification-as-Product (Sp-a-a-S)**, a paradigm that transforms how software products are conceived, built, and delivered.

### Core Concept

Instead of selling code artifacts (traditional SaaS), this paradigm sells ontological specifications from which code is generated on-demand based on customer needs. Think "à-la-carte at buffet economics" - customers get tailored software at SaaS speed and cost.

### The Four Pillars

1. **Semantic Engineering** - Domain knowledge in machine-readable ontologies (Functional, Design, Architecture, Code), enabling 80%+ development cost reduction
2. **Local-First Architecture** - Customer's device as infrastructure, eliminating per-user hosting costs and enabling offline capability
3. **Market Expansion** - Combined economics make previously unviable market segments (small niches, emerging markets) profitable
4. **Business Model Innovation** - Feature-based and usage-based pricing aligned with actual value delivered

### Key Ontology Types

| Ontology | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Functional | What users can accomplish (Personas → Outcomes → Scenarios → Steps → Actions) |
| Design | User experience (Journeys → Flows → Pages → Components) |
| Architecture | System structure (Layers → Services → Agents → APIs) |
| Code | Implementation patterns (Applications → Modules → Classes → Functions) |

## Repository Structure

- `concept/` - Conceptual documents and specifications
  - `Introduction to Sp-a-a-S.md` - Main paradigm specification document

## Current Status

This is an early-stage conceptual repository. No build system, tests, or code implementations exist yet.
